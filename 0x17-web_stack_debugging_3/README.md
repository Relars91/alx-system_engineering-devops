# 0x17. Web stack debugging #3 by Uche 

This marked the fourth project within a series focused on debugging web stacks. In these projects, I received malfunctioning web stacks enclosed within isolated containers and was tasked with restoring them to a functional state. To accomplish each task, I developed scripts to automate the required commands for repairing the web stack.
